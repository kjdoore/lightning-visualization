> NOTE: These codes are written in the Interactive Data Language (IDL) and require IDL version 8.3 or later. They additionally depend on the [IDL Astronomy User's Library](https://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov), [IDL Coyote](http://www.idlcoyote.com), [Lightning](https://github.com/rafaeleufrasio/lightning). All three dependencies will need to be installed and [added to your IDL path](https://www.l3harrisgeospatial.com/Support/Self-Help-Tools/Help-Articles/Help-Articles-Detail/ArtMID/10220/ArticleID/16156/Quick-tips-for-customizing-your-IDL-program-search-path) before using.
